The goal is to help the patient determine an accurate diagnosis or diagnoses. Even if a diagnosis seems obvious, other conditions will be ruled out such as depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety, psychosis, addiction and certain medical conditions, as these conditions influence which medications and therapeutic treatment options would be most suitable. In some cases, it can take several follow up sessions to further clarify the diagnosis.</div>

Once the patient is doing better and the symptoms have stabilized, the frequency of the appointments will decrease. Since every patient has different needs, each patient is treated with a personalized approach that enable us to work together toward a common goal of optimal mental health. It is not uncommon during a patientâ€™s treatment plan to try several medications over time in order to achieve optimum results.</div>
